## Introduction
We all know, businesses always look out for efficient ways to promote their products. Keeping that in mind, I
have created a web application
that mentions all the YouTuberâ€™s details, like name, pricing, work, etc., in one place,
helping businesses sort Youtubers efficiently, according to their need, vision, and
budget.

```
git clone https://github.com/freakfan15/Tubers.git
```
2. Install dependencies.
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
3. Start the server
```
python manage.py runserver
```


## Technology Stack
1) Django
2) PostgresSQL
3) HTML 
4) CSS
5) JavaScript

## Features
1) All CRUD functionalities for creating, reading, updating and deleting information of different youtubers.
2) All the features can be directly controlled and customised by a custom built admin panel.
3) Implemented keyword based search.
4) Implemented authentication including OAuth Google login.
